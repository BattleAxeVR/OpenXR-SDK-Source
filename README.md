BRANCH: QUEST CLIENT USING OCULUS INSTRUCTIONS FROM HERE:

QUEST PRO EYE TRACKING sample on PC VR via Link / AirLink (enable Dev mode + eye-tracking sliders in Oculus PC app):


NB This same exact code should work on Quest Pro standalone mode, but I didn't add the request permissions Java code for eye-tracking (which needs to be accepted for it to work). There is no java code in this project so it will probably have to be done via JNI / Android Native somehow. I'll try to add that soon.

Body tracking extension works fine on Standalone but gives a runtime error on PC via Link.

I also implemented waist-oriented locomotion, where available. This works on Quest 1, 2, and Pro, both on Android and Link/AirLink on PC. 

I posted a hello_xr.exe test app and an OpenGL ES / Vulkan pre-built APK for SideLoading / ADB pushing to try it out quickly.

NB: On standalone builds, you need to run this ADB command to enable experimental features:

adb shell setprop debug.oculus.experimentalEnabled 1

-----
UPDATE: Support for HTC Vive Ultimate trackers (and presumably older HTC Trackers) has been added, for the waist to use for waist-oriented locomotion. It works VERY well, very 
responsive to body movements.
